# Fire Station Placement Optimization System
**Case Study: Emergency Response Allocation in Depok City**

## 📌 Project Overview
This project applies **Computational Thinking** methodologies to optimize the placement and quantity of fire stations in Depok City. By analyzing district-specific data such as population density, total area, and traffic levels, the system provides a data-driven approach to emergency resource management.

## 🛠️ Key Features & Logic
* **Demand Estimation:** Calculates the required number of fire stations based on population density thresholds and total land area.
* **Response Time Simulation:** Estimates arrival times by factoring in road traffic levels (on a scale of 1-10) and building types.
* **Resource Validation:** Identifies "high-risk" districts where estimated response times exceed safety maximums, suggesting necessary adjustments.

## 💻 Tech Stack & Libraries
* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** * `IPython.display`: Used for professional rendering of district connectivity and assignment tables.
* **Methodology:** Computational Thinking (Decomposition, Pattern Recognition, Abstraction, and Algorithm Design).

## 📊 How It Works
The system processes interactive user input for various districts, including:
1. **District Name** (e.g., Depok, Jakarta, Bogor)
2. **Total Area** (km²)
3. **Population Density** (people/km²)
4. **Traffic Levels** (1-10 scale)
5. **Building Types** (e.g., Residential, Industrial, Farm)
6. **District Connectivity** (Neighboring districts)
